# Contra-sem2Project

# Description:
This a game that I made for school using a custom engine. The sole reason why I chose this game is because I used to play this when I was small, So I wanted to recreate it myself. The game is made using a C++ programming language. The camera movement, the sprites and levels are all self made. To make the sprites come alive opengl is used. The level is read from a file and parsed as vertices in the game.
